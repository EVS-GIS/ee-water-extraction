# GloUrbEE - Extract GloUrb metrics and indicators from Google Earth Engine

# Installation

- Windows
```powershell
python -m venv env --prompt glourbee
.\env\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

- Linux
```bash
python -m venv env --prompt glourbee
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

# Example usage

The `notebook.ipynb` file contains example of how to use the GloUrbEE tool.

# Start the UI

The GloUrbEE-UI allow you to use the main GloUrbEE package workflow with a fancy user-friendly interface.

## With streamlit 

- Windows
```powershell
.\env\Scripts\activate
streamlit run ui/00_üè†_HomePage.py
```

- Linux
```bash
source env/bin/activate
streamlit run ui/00_üè†_HomePage.py
```

## With docker

```bash
docker run -v /data/glourbee-ui.db:/app/ui/li/db/glourbee-ui.db ghcr.io/evs-gis/glourbee-ui:latest 
```

If you want the database to be persistent, you can mount /app/ui/lib/db/glourbee-ui.db in a docker volume.
